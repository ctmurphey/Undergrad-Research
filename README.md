# Undergrad-Research

A select collection of the work I did in my my undergraduate at the University of Illinois, resulting in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06552) which would go on to be published in [*Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/507/1/927/6330468?redirectedFrom=fulltext). The work centered around modeling both what fraction of supernovae in the Milky Way we are likely to see and where to see it, building off of the models in [Adams, et. al., (2013)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0559.pdf).
